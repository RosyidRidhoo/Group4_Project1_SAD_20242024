The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach for developing information systems, ensuring high-quality software that meets customer expectations within time and budget constraints. This report provides an overview of the SDLC phases, methodologies, and best practices. By understanding and adhering to the SDLC, project teams can deliver robust and efficient software solutions that meet business goals and user requirements.
We will use the SDLC architecture in this project to create a robust and all-encompassing system. The SDLC process utilised in this particular system project is described in this paper, along with every step of the process from feasibility studies to maintenance. Project managers, developers, stakeholders, and team members can use it as a reference to make sure that every step of the process—from early planning to final deployment—is carefully followed and recorded.
To successfully manage projects and develop software, one must have a solid understanding of the SDLC. Clear communication between team members and stakeholders is facilitated, risks are reduced, and a clear roadmap is provided. Project teams can find this guide useful in navigating the intricacies of software development and finally providing a solution that meets user needs and corporate objectives. It demonstrates the phases, processes, and practical applications of the software development life cycle.
