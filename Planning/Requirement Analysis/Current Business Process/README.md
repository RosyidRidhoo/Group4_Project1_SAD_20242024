to access any benefits of KADA, one must first become a member of the cooperative. If someone is not already a member, they must register. This registration process involves a strict procedure: every application is reviewed during board meetings. Additionally, all members must pay a monthly membership fee of approximately 50 RM.

They can use the advantages of KADA membership, like loan applications, after they become members.
