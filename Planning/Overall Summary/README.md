An automated system will be put in place for KADA in order to address the existing issues. Its main objectives are to improve the member experience by accomplishing many goals. First and foremost, the system will promote trust and accountability by giving members unrestricted access to comprehensive information and real-time updates. Second, by combining all business processes into KADA through a user-friendly interface, it will increase efficiency by streamlining navigation and automating repetitive procedures, freeing up staff to concentrate on more strategic work. Thirdly, moving to a digital database would free up space for data administration and drastically lower the possibility of human mistake, producing data that is more precise and dependable and essential for reporting and decision-making.. Lastly, the system will enhance accessibility by enabling members and staff to access KADA services from anywhere without the need to attend physically, thereby offering convenience and ensuring that services are available 24/7.
