To enable the effective deployment and continuous operation of the proposed automated system at KADA, a number of human resources would be required. The following are the principal roles and duties necessary:

Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the entire implementation process, coordinating with various stakeholders, managing timelines, and ensuring that project goals are met within budget and schedule constraints.

Business Analyst: Analyzes the current business processes at KADA, identifies requirements for the new system, and translates them into functional specifications. Works closely with stakeholders to gather and prioritize requirements.

System Architect: Designs the overall system architecture, including hardware and software components, to meet the requirements specified by the business analyst. Ensures that the system is scalable, secure, and integrates seamlessly with existing systems.

Software Developers: Develop and customize the software components of the automated system according to the specifications provided by the business analyst and system architect. This may include front-end interfaces, back-end databases, and integrations with other systems.

Database Administrator: Responsible for designing and maintaining the database infrastructure that supports the automated system. Ensures data integrity, security, and performance optimization.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Conducts testing of the automated system to identify and resolve any defects or issues before deployment. Develops test plans, executes test cases, and verifies that the system meets functional and performance requirements.

Training Coordinator: Develops training materials and conducts training sessions for KADA staff to ensure they are proficient in using the new system. Provides ongoing support and assistance as needed.

Technical Support Staff: Provides front-line support to KADA staff in using the automated system, troubleshoots technical issues, and escalates complex issues to the appropriate teams for resolution.


Security Specialist: Implements and maintains security measures to protect the automated system from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. Monitors system logs and conducts regular security audits.

These human resources, with their varied skill sets and knowledge, will be essential to the automated system's effective installation and operation at KADA, guaranteeing that the system's objectives of accessibility, efficiency, transparency, and data management are met.
