The current system of KADA is sufficient in terms of usability and purposes, effectively meeting the basic needs and expectations of its users. However, it's worth nothing that key functionalities such as member management, financial tracking, applying loan,  reporting, and administrative tasks, which are crucial for maintaining accurate records, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions, are still being handled manually.

Because of that, the system is far from perfect. There are several critical issues that can hinder the cooperative experience, including transparency and accountability, efficiency, data management, and accessibility. These problems can negatively impact user satisfaction and operational effectiveness. To address these challenges and enhance the overall cooperative experience, it is essential to consider building a new system. By following the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the implementation of the new system can be smooth and seamless, ensuring that improvements are systematically and effectively integrated.
