To ensure a seamless transition to the new system, KADA will need to conduct a demo or training for all members. Through this training, they will become acquainted with the features and functionalities of the new system, facilitating an easy adoption process. A software engineer will also need to be hired by KADA in order to maintain the system and make sure it functions as intended. KADA may maximize the system's benefits for the organization and its members by investing in continuous maintenance and support, which will also optimize the system's performance and dependability.
