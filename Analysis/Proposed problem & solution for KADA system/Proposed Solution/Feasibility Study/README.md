An automated mechanism for KADA must be put in place to handle these problems. The members' experience with KADA will be improved with this technology, which will also address the problems. The new system aims to accomplish the following main objectives:

Transparency, the new system will implement transparency by opening access of reports or information to KADA members.
Efficiency, the new system will integrate all the KADA business seamlessly by offering an easy to navigate interface.
Data management, a digital database is making sure that no more limited space for data management and reducing the prone to human error.
Accessibility, the implementation of the new system will open up the possibility of accessing KADA from anywhere without attending physically.

Before implementing the new system, conducting a feasibility study is imperative to determine whether the resources at KADA are sufficient. This study will assess various factors such as financial resources, technical capabilities, and human resources available within the organization. By assessing these factors, KADA can determine whether putting the new system into place is feasible and can also spot any obstacles or problems that may arise in advance.
