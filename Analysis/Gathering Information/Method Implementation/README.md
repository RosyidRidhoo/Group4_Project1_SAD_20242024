Ridho: Assalamualaikum Justin, it's great to have you here today. Before we dive into the details, could you introduce yourself?

Justin: Waalaikumsalam Ridho, sure. I'm Justin, currently in my second year of college, studying Software Engineering. I've always had a passion for technology and problem-solving, which led me to pursue this major.

Interviewer (Ridho): Thank: That's fantastic, Justin. It's great to hear about your interests and aspirations.. I understand you're interested in learning more about the types of loans offered by our cooperative. Let's dive right in. Could you describe each type of loan in more detail?


Justin: Of course, Ridho. There are five types of loans available to our members. Firstly, we have the Al-Bai Loan, which operates on a sales-based model. The cooperative purchases an item and then sells it to the member at a profit, to be repaid in installments.

Ridho: Interesting. And what about the Al-Innah Loan?

Justin: The Al-Innah Loan involves a buy-back agreement. Here, the cooperative sells an asset to the member and then buys it back at a lower price, providing the member with liquidity.

Ridho: That sounds like it could be quite beneficial. What about the Special Scheme Loan?

Justin: Ah, the Special Scheme Loan is designed for specific purposes such as education, housing, or business investments. We tailor the terms of this loan to meet the individual needs of our members.

Ridho: And how about the Road Tax and Insurance Loan?

Justin: This loan covers the costs of road tax and insurance for vehicles, allowing our members to spread these payments over time.

Ridho: Got it. And finally, the Al-Qardhul Hasan Loan?

Justin: Yes, this is an interest-free loan provided based on the member's share in the cooperative. Up to 80% of their share value can be guaranteed with this loan.

Ridho: Thank you for the detailed explanation, Justin. Now, moving on, is this system used for all types of loans or does it focus on just one loan?

Justin: This system applies to all loans because the profit percentage remains consistent across the board.

Ridho: Understood. Now, let's talk about dividend calculations. Could you explain the method in more detail?

Justin: Certainly. The dividend calculation is determined by an appointed external auditor. They handle the calculations to ensure fairness and accuracy.

Ridho: Thank you for clarifying that. And one last question, if an application to become a cooperative member is not approved, is it possible to appeal again?

Justin: Absolutely. If an application is not approved, the individual can certainly submit an appeal for reconsideration.

Ridho: Perfect. Thank you so much, Justin, for providing such insightful information about our cooperative's loan system and processes.

Justin: You're welcome, Ridho. It was my pleasure to help clarify these aspects for you. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
