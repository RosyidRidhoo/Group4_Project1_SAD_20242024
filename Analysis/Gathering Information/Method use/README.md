Interviews are a key method for gathering detailed information from stakeholders in system development, involving direct discussions with end-users, clients, subject matter experts, or project stakeholders. In this project, we are using the interview method to gather essential information. Creating open-ended questions, identifying participants, and setting objectives are all part of the preparation process. Setting up an appointment, selecting an appropriate setting, utilizing prepared questions, and paying close attention to thorough notes are all part of conducting an interview. After the interview, the notes are typed, examined for important themes, and the conclusions are confirmed with the interview subjects. Interviews are time-consuming, somewhat subjective, and demand excellent communication skills, but they also yield rich insights, allow for flexible inquiry, foster rapport, and eventually aid in customizing system development to user requirements and expectations.
